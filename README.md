# Arbitrage Betting Slovakia

A simple guide on how to perform arbitrage betting on Slovak betting platforms.

Supported bookmakers: **Tipsport, Nik√©, Fortuna, Doxxbet, Synottip, Tipos**

This guide assumes you already understand arbitrage betting, so it skips the basics and directly provides instructions on how to use the arbitrage scanner app designed specifically for Slovak bookmakers.

**Note:** A monthly subscription fee (approximately 5‚Äì10 USD, paid via blockchain in SOL) is required. You can cancel your subscription at any time and receive back unused SOL.
